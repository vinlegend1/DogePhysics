        "hint": "If the velocity in the x direction is constant? Do you need to worry about that? Just say sorry about that, and move on to v_y. Remember thy how velocity changes over time? Do you know \"How it works?\" because you'll be accelerating at $ 9.8 \\frac{m}{s^{2}} $ to the answer. No one told you, but listen closely, but the magnitude of the velocity is represented by $ |v| = \\sqrt{v_{x}^{2} + v_{y}^{2}}$. You got it?",

## How does this simulation work, you may ask? This simulation is a rough esitimate of how the real world would operate. Makes sense? Now, the sneaky trick to how this simulation works is... just simple **maths**. I know, you don't like math, I get that; but in reality, math is just a simple language in which we can interpret physical phenomena in the universe. Lemme show you that, trust me, you won't hate it.

## Let's make a deal, I'll give you three simple equations but *you listen closely*. Sound fair enough?
![Eq. 1.1.1. Three Key Kinematic Equations](/eqs/eq1-1-1.png "Eq. 1.1.1. Three Key Kinematic Equations")

## Vince! You told me this was simple, no? What gives? Ok, can you identify the names of the variables are? X is position in the x direction, yeah? V is just the velocity, yeah? And a is the acceleration? Now notice how similar they are to the variables on the control panel. No? They're not? Let me tell you that they in fact are similar!

## The variables x and y represent the *position* of the object, right? The variable v_x and v_y represent the *velocity* of the object, right? Finally, g is the vertical acceleration of the object, or you may know it as the gravitational acceleration. And time is represented by t. But look at the equations I showed you, they're the most general form.

## `a` is just a number because we assume it doesn't change over time, right? But look at the others, they all have *time*, do you see a pattern? Velocity changes due to acceleration, right? And position changes due to velocity, which is changing due to acceleration. I won't be too technical with my explanations, but you can follow, right? Position changes due to velocity, in which velocity changes due to acceleration. Ok. But why do I have different equations from class?

## Take a close look at the equations. You may have seen x = vt, but have you realized that **It's just the same**!!! What??? Look, what happens if I set acceleration in the first equation to zero? BOOOM! Exactly. In fact, the true beauty of those equations is that they're very intuitive.

## Now you have a more intuitive feel for Kinematics: Free Fall, feel free to mess around with the controls. See if the equations hold true for every single value possible? We also have **missions** for you to complete, after all, the best way to learn is to get some practice.
